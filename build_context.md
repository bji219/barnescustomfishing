# Build Context
## Overview
1. The goal of this project is to build a website for "Barnes Custom Fishing". This is a project for a tuna fishing rod craftsman to showcase his work and potentially attract customers. The customer is based out of Manahawkin, NJ. 
2. The website will be hosted on Vercel. Test the website on localhost initially until functional but setup necessary Vercel config files.
4. Create any linting and tests required to get the site functional. Use Playwright to test in browser if necessary.
5. The website should have a minimalistic style focused on showcasing the art that the client produces with minimal text (but optional to add descriptions or captions to images as needed).
6. The site should link to the client's instagram page for more.
